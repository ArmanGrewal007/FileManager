# FileManager

File-Manager app using `Node.js` + `Express.js` in backend which sends file to a private `AWS S3 bucket`.

## ðŸš€ How to run?

1. Clone the repo to your local machine.
2. `Node.js` and `npm` must be installed.
3. Open your project in VSCode for better experience.
4. Run `npm install` to install all necessary modules
5. `awscli` must be installed to setup AWS environment variables with ease (*recommended*)
    1. For mac run - `brew install awscli`
    2. For windows you have to install it from [AWS official website](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
    3. After installing run `aws configure` in VSCode's terminal and specify `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, which can be obtained from **`Backend/.env`** file.
    4. Alternatively you can `export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="id_provided_there"` and `export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="id_provided_there"` in the VSCode's terminal, if you don't want to use AWS' cli.
6. `pgadmin 4` (PostgreSQL GUI) should be installed and should have a server and a database on it. One must go to **`Backend/db_init.js`** and configure your database first. (Note: App will create the tables itself, one only needs to setup the database)
7.  App is ready to run (by default on [https://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)) --> run the command `npm start` to fire up ðŸš€

> **NOTE**
About AWS S3 credentials - *I have setup the AccessKey and SecretAccessKey using custom IAM policy, they provide limited flexibility (enough for this small project), and key will expire on Aug 16, 2023 EOD (UTC timezone)*

##  ðŸ›  App structure

App structure is bifurcated into Fronted and Backend folders.

### Frontend 
It contains several HTML files, i.e. all the files served using our backend. <br>
I haven't used any frontend library, maybe will update it in future âœ”

### Backend 
It contains all necessary JavaScript files, that maintain all the functionality.

### Basic overview of all contents 

| Sr no. | File/Folder name | Description |
| -- | -- | -- |
| 1 | **db_init.js** | PostgresSQL database setup and tables initialization |
| 2 | **db.js** | All methods related to user login/register (*users* table) |
| 3 | **file_manager.js** | All methods related to *folders* and *files* tables |
| 4 | **index.js** | Main file that contains all necessary API endpoints | 
| 5 | **.env** | Environment variable configuration file | 
| 6 | **uploads/** | Folder which stores files temporarily (for validation checks) before pushing them to s3 bucket |

### Detailed overview of all contents 

#### 1. db_init.js 

Uses the `pg` package to setup connection to our database. <br>
We have 3 tables in our database - 
<table>
<tr><th colspan="4" align="center"> users </th></tr>
<tr><th> id </th> <th> username </th> <th> email </th> <th> password_hash </th> </tr> 
<tr><td> user id </td><td> Registered user </td><td> Email of that user </td><td> Hashed password of that user (using bcrypt) </td> </tr>
</table>

<table>
<tr><th colspan="6" align="center"> folders </th></tr>
<tr><th> id </th> <th> name </th> <th> created_by </th> <th> parent_foler </th> <th> s3_object_key </th> <th> created_at </th> </tr> 
<tr><td> folder id </td><td> folder name </td><td> Username of user who created that folder </td><td> Parent folder id (<code>null</code> if there is no parent) </td> <td> Unique key to identify object in s3 bucket </td> <td> Timestamp of creation</td> </tr>
</table>

<table>
<tr><th colspan="7" align="center"> files </th></tr>
<tr><th> id </th> <th> name </th> <th> size </th> <th> uploaded_by </th> <th> parent_foler </th> <th> s3_object_key </th> <th> created_at </th> </tr> 
<tr><td> file id </td><td> file name </td> <th> size in bytes </th><td> Username of user who created that file </td><td> Parent folder id (<code>null</code> if there is no parent) </td> <td> Unique key to identify object in s3 bucket </td> <td> Timestamp of creation</td> </tr>
</table>

`initialize_tables()` creates these 3 necessary tables, if they are not already created.

#### 2. db.js 

`register_user(username, email, password)` Registers the user by adding it to *users* table <br>
`login_user(username, password)` Logs the user in by confirming its username and matching provided password with password from *users* table
<br>
`showUsers()` Debugging function to `SELECT * FROM users`. 

#### 3. file_manager.js
**LOGIC :** <br>
> **ðŸ¤”One user cannot create folder with same name twice., but two users can create folders with same names.**
 
*HOW I DID IT?* ðŸ‘‰ In s3 bucket, give all users their individual "home" folders (username arman will have a "arman/" folder), and add folders inside them ("arman/myfolder") and after succesful folder creation, add the foldername, username etc. to *folders* table. Also note that s3 allows user to upload same named objects again and again, and overwrites them. To prevent that we do a SQL query on our *folder* table to check if user has not already created folder with same name and then put the object on s3! <br>

> **ðŸ¤”One user cannot create subfolder with same name inside a folder, but he can create subfolders with same name inside different folders**

*HOW I DID IT?* ðŸ‘‰ Similar to above approach we first check using SQL query if there isn't already a "folder", created by "user" and has same "parent folder" too. If all checks pass, put the object to s3 bucket, and later update the *folders* table too <br>

> **ðŸ¤”One user cannot create file with same name inside a folder, but he can create a file with same name in different folders.** 

*HOW I DID IT?* ðŸ‘‰ Exact same approach, how files are to subfolders is analogous to how subfolders are to folders <br>

> **ðŸ¤”User can create file without any folders** 

*HOW I DID IT?* ðŸ‘‰ parent_folder property of *files* table can also be <code>null</code>, and put the file directly in root folder "username/" <br>


`checkFolder(username, foldername)` Returns false if given "username" has already created a "foldername" <br>
`checkSubFolder(username, sub_folder_name, parent_folder_name)` Returns false if "username" has already created a "parent_folder_name/sub_folder_name" <br>
`checkFile(filename, username, sub_folder_name=null)` Returns false if "username" has already created a "sub_folder_name/filename". If sub_folder_name=null, we are in root directory, and we can't have same named files there too! <br>
`uploadFolder(username, foldername, etag, parent_folder=null)` Update the *folders* table by uploading folder to it.<br>
`uploadFile(filename, username, size, etag, sub_folder_name=null)` Update the *files* table by uploading file to it.<br>
`showFolders()` Debugging function to `SELECT * FROM folders`. <br>
`showFiles()` Debugging function to `SELECT * FROM files`.  <br>
